- 👋 Hello, My name is Denis Laesker. I am a computer scientist and researcher. 
- 👀 I’m interested in a wide range of topics, some of which include Sound, Music, Neuroscience, Mathematics, Programming, Languages, Sound Health, DSP, Graphics, and Video Game development. These are not listed in any particular order.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things to list them all. However, most likely something related to mathematics, sound/audio, graphics, and how the brain works. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...hmmm...why don't you shoot me a message instead?
